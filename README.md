## Project Description
My Pharmacy System is a Java console-based project for managing medicines, sales, and stock in a pharmacy. It reduces manual work and keeps records organized.

The project uses multiple classes for different tasks:
* *AddMedicine.java* → Adds new medicines
* *DeleteMedicine.java* → Removes medicines
* *UpdateMedicine.java* → Updates medicine details
* *ViewMedicine.java* → Views all medicines
* *SearchMedicine.java* → Searches medicine by name or ID
* *SellMedicine.java* → Processes sales and calculates bills
* *StockAlert.java* → Alerts when stock is below 5 units
* *SalesReport.java* → Generates sales report

All classes are connected and run from the *Main.java* file, which is the starting point of the program.
